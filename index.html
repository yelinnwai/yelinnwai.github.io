              I am pursing BSc degree in Computer Science at University of
              London.
            </p>
            <p>

              Programming, Discrete Maths, Introduction to Programming II, Web
              Development, Computation Mathematics, Algorithms and Data
              Structures I, Fundamentals of Computer Science, Object Oriented
              Programming, Graphics Programming, Databases and Networks and the
              Web, Software Design and Development, Agile Software Projects,
              Programming with Data, Computer Security

            <h2>Publication</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I wrote my first book at the age of 16. This technology guide book
              was the best seller in Myanmar. Before publishing my first book, I
              wrote a few articles in well-known IT journals such as Internet
              Journal, NetGuide under my author name called Moe Lone Pyae Shan.
              So far, I have written two best-selling Android User Guide books
              in Burmese.
            </p>

                (A tiny contriubtion on Unsplash. Normally, I like to take the
                nature and building pictures.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Gaming (I have both Nintendo Switch and PS5. Most of the time, I
                am just staring at them without turning on since I have to study
                and work. But I managed to complete a few games. Some of my
                favorite titles are Astral Chain, Luigi's Mansion 3, Super Mario
                Odyssey, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn, Spider-Man
                Series.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Swimming (I started learning how to swim later this year. Within
                two weeks, I was able to swim freestyle and backstroke. My
                current swimming record is 30 seconds for a 25-meter swim,
                considering I'm a recreational swimmer. I'm practicing to
                improve my techniques and aim to swim faster than my current
                record.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Roadtrip (Since I enjoy exploring new places, I often drive
                around cities and the countryside. Fancy a drive? I recommend
                checking out Fujiyoshida. I've been there quite a few times and
                have never been bored. The atmosphere changes every time I
                visit. Please be careful while driving; there are many mountains
                in the area.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Teaching (Last but not least, I love to share the knowledge I
                have. While studying, I work as a coding teacher at
                <a href="https://youcode.jp/" target="_blank">YouCode</a> and
                teaching assistant at
                <a href="https://www.codechrysalis.io/" target="_blank"
                  >Code Chrysalis</a
                >. I would do it for free, even if I didn't get paid.
                Fortunately, I've been able to cover my tuition fees with the
                income from those teaching hours.)
