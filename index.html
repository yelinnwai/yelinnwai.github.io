            <p>
              I am pursing BSc degree in Computer Science at University of
              London.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've taken these modules in University. Introduction to
              Programming, Discrete Maths, Introduction to Programming II, Web
              Development, Computation Mathematics, Algorithms and Data
              Structures I, Fundamentals of Computer Science, Object Oriented
              Programming, Graphics Programming, Databases and Networks and the
              Web, Software Design and Development, Agile Software Projects,
              Programming with Data, Computer Security
            </p>

              This e-magazine website is dedicated for EV news and reviews. I
              used grid and flex layouts to make this website. Handlebarsjs is
              new to me. I tried to implement after I wrote HTML & CSS. I
              successfully refactored the previous highlight news session on
              main page. Although I implemented web accessibility, I would add
              other accessibility features if I have another time.

              I wrote my first book at the age of 16 (2012). This technology
              guide book was the best seller in Myanmar. Before publishing my
              first book, I wrote a few articles in well-known IT journals such
              as Internet Journal, NetGuide under my author name called Moe Lone
              Pyae Shan.

                Gaming (I have both Nintendo Switch and PS5. Most of the time, I
                am just staring at them without turning on since I have to study
                and work. But I managed to complete a few games. Some of my
                favorite titles are Astral Chain, Luigi's Mansion 3, Super Mario
                Odyssey, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn, Spider-Man
                Series.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Swimming (I embarked on learning how to swim during my adult years. I participated in the 108 swim challenge event at the end of 2023 in Japan. I completed 25 meters 108 times, swimming in two hours.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Roadtrip (Since I enjoy exploring new places, I often drive
                around cities and the countryside. Fancy a drive? I recommend
                checking out Fujiyoshida. I've been there quite a few times and
                have never been bored. The atmosphere changes every time I
                visit. Please be careful while driving; there are many mountains
                in the area.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Teaching (Last but not least, I love to share the knowledge I
                have. While studying, I work as a coding teacher at
